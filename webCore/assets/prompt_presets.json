Your task is to generate exactly {COUNT} high-quality flashcards about \"{TOPIC}\".\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Create exactly {COUNT} flashcards\n- Focus specifically on {TOPIC}\n- Each flashcard should have a clear, concise question on the front and a comprehensive answer on the back\n- Questions should test understanding, not just memorization\n- Answers should be informative but not overly long (aim for 1-3 sentences)\n- Cover different aspects and difficulty levels of the topic\n- Ensure questions are specific and unambiguous\n\n**Output Format:**\nReturn your response as a valid JSON object with this exact structure with nothing that will break the json only use double quotes when starting or ending a string or object name or value:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\n      \"front\": \"Question or prompt here\",\n      \"back\": \"Clear, concise answer here\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Example for Spanish Vocabulary:**\n```json\n{\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\n      \"front\": \"What is the Spanish word for 'house'?\",\n      \"back\": \"Casa (feminine noun, pronounced 'KAH-sah')\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"front\": \"How do you say 'I am hungry' in Spanish?\",\n      \"back\": \"Tengo hambre (literally 'I have hunger')\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAlso note that you should only use ' (single quotes) when quoting strings. This is because the JSON parser will interpret the string as a JSON object.\n\nNow create {COUNT} flashcards about {TOPIC}. Remember to return only valid JSON - no additional text or explanations outside the JSON structure.\n"
